    "1. When ClinicalActivity and Appointment grow to tens of millions of rows, partitioning by date becomes very useful.\n",
    " - Partitioning speeds up queries that filter on recent dates because MySQL scans only the relevant partitions instead of the entire table. As fewer rows are read, query execution time is significantly reduced.\n",
    " - Partitioning has a strong positive impact on maintenance tasks such as archiving old data. Old data can be efficiently removed or archived by dropping or moving entire partitions, which avoids expensive row-by-row deletions\n",
    " - Queries that do not include a filter on Date may need to scan all partitions, which can be slower than scanning a non-partitioned table.Partitioning complicates key and index design, increasing storage usage and index maintenance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Partitioning Stock by HID \n",
    "- Partitioning Stock by HID is beneficial for:Checking available medications for a specific hospital.and Queries that include conditions such as WHERE Stock.HID = ...;\n",
    "- Not all hospitals have the same amount of stock data. Some hospitals may have many medications and frequent updates, while others have fewer records. This can lead to unbalanced partitions.\n",
    "To reduce this risk, partitioning by region or by groups of hospitals can be a better alternative\n",
    "- Partitioning by HID works well with joins on the same attribute. It reduces the number of rows involved in the join, making join operations more efficient due to smaller input datasets"
